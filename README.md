# Reaction Time and Accuracy in Aim-Based Tasks

## Overview  
This project explores how **hand dominance** and **mouse sensitivity (DPI)** affect reaction time and accuracy in aim-based digital tasks. Using data collected from ten participants on the *Aim400kg* platform, the study applies **Fitts’ Law** and **Hick’s Law** to analyze the trade-off between speed and precision.  

## Key Features  
- **Empirical Analysis:** Tested dominant vs. non-dominant hand performance under varying DPI settings.  
- **Statistical Modeling:** Applied **Two-Way ANOVA**, **Shapiro-Wilk**, and **Levene’s** tests in R.  
- **Performance Insights:** Found significant effects of both hand dominance and sensitivity on reaction time.  

## Objectives  
To understand how ergonomic and technical factors influence digital motor performance and provide insights for optimizing user precision and response speed.
